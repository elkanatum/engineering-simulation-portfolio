## 📌 Project Overview

Engineering Simulations with Game Development Tools (ESGDT) is a real-time simulation project focused on visualizing autonomous vehicle behavior using the Bevy game engine. This simulation leverages Rust and OpenGL principles to animate realistic vehicle dynamics, steering behavior, and potential environment interactions.

Our project explores how game development frameworks can enhance engineering simulations with interactive visuals and user-driven input.
