# üõ†Ô∏è Project Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio for Engineering Simulations and Systems Development!  
This repository showcases key academic and personal projects that demonstrate my skills in real-time simulation, system-level programming, and algorithmic development.

Each project explores different aspects of simulation, from visualizing autonomous vehicle behavior to building powerful Python utilities for data formatting and transformation.

## üöó Capstone Project: ESGDT ‚Äì Engineering Simulations with Game Development Tools  
**[View Project](https://github.com/sahilg2000/ESGDT)**

A real-time simulation visualizing autonomous vehicle behavior using the Bevy game engine in Rust.  
The project simulates dynamic steering logic, collision response, and path-following systems, incorporating OpenGL concepts for rendering.

**Technologies:**  
- Rust  
- Bevy (game engine)  
- Cargo (Rust build system)  
- OpenGL concepts

## ‚≠ê Number Utils Library  
**[View Project Folder](https://github.com/chengmic/ci_project)**

A Python utility library offering reliable conversion tools for numeric data:
- Convert strings to integers, floats, or hexadecimal
- Handle endianness formatting
- Convert Unix timestamps to human-readable date formats

Includes over 10,000 unit tests for validation and robustness.

**Technologies:**  
- Python 3.x  
- `unittest` framework  
- No external dependencies

## üìå About This Portfolio

This portfolio was built as part of my coursework at Oregon State University to demonstrate:
- Proficiency in simulation and visualization tools
- Development of reusable libraries and test-driven workflows
- Strong grasp of algorithmic thinking and software design

Feel free to explore each project folder for source code, documentation, and test suites.
